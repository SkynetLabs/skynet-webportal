**BOSTON, Massachusetts, March 22, 2021** — Skynet Labs introduces new paid accounts and sets the stage for recursive content monetization. To celebrate, Skynet is giving out premium accounts to the first 100 users who sign up at siasky.net. The giveaway includes 1 TB of storage and 3 months of censorship-resistant file pinning. Skynet is a decentralized CDN and foundation for a new, decentralized internet. It is an open protocol for building decentralized applications, and is built on top of Sia, a decentralized storage network.

Soon, creators will be able to set the price per view or download of their work and earn directly from their blogs, photos, and videos in real time. In this way, recursive content monetization reduces artists’ dependency on traditional advertising to make ends meet. When users pay for premium accounts in fiat, they provide a steady revenue stream from which to pay out content creators.

Application developers will also benefit from content monetization. Like content creators, developers can attach price tags to their applications. Per David Vorick, Skynet Labs CEO and Lead Developer, “We believe that developers and content creators alike should be able to earn income off of their hard work so long as they have users that appreciate what they do.”

Skynet Labs has always been committed to the freedom of expression, information, and importantly, access. Therefore, Skynet’s Free account tier supporting up to 100 GB of data, seeks to ensure that financial barriers never prohibit users and developers from participating in the Skynet ecosystem. Once a user meets their data cap, service on Skynet will continue but at reduced speeds, in a way similar to data plans for smartphones.

Overall, users can opt for one of three paid tiers: $5/month with 1 TB, $20/month with 4 TB, or $80/month with 20 TB of data. Skynet Premium also comes with significant performance boosts: users will be able to pin content and browse Skynet faster, in particular any pages with monetized content. The benefits of a premium account are not purely in performance—these users are actively fueling a new creator economy, and a revolution that gives creators everywhere the power they deserve.
