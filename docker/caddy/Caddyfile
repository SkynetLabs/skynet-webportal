# This block below is optional if you want to generate internal certificate for the server ip address.

# Make sure you have SSL_CERTIFICATE_STRING specified in .env file because you need it to fetch correct certificates.
# It needs to have at least 3 parts, the absolute part (ie. example.com), the wildcard part (ie. *.example.com) and
# the hns wildcard part (ie. *.hns.example.com). The resulting string should look like:
# example.com, *.example.com, *.hns.example.com
# In addition, if you are running multiple servers for the single portal like we do on siasky.net, you might want to
# add an aliased string that is going to help you access and distinguish between servers, the result would look like:
# example.com, *.example.com, *.hns.example.com, *.germany.example.com, *.hns.germany.example.com
# Note that you don't need to specify the absolute part for the alias since it's already covered in the wildcard part 
# of the original certificate string (*.example.com).
